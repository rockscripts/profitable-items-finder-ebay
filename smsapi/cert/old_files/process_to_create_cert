To generate a certificate on a Mac OS X:

Log-in to the iPhone Developer Program Portal
Choose App IDs from the menu on the right (or click here)
Create an App ID without a wildcard. For example 3L223ZX9Y3.com.armiento.test
Click the Configure link next to this App ID and then click on the button to start the wizard to generate a new Development Push SSL Certificate (Apple Documentation: Creating the SSL Certificate and Keys)
Download this certificate and double click on aps_developer_identity.cer to import it into your Keychain
Launch Keychain Assistant (located in Application, Utilities or search for it with Spotlight) and click on My Certificates on the left
Expand Apple Development Push Services and select Apple Development Push Services AND your private key (just under Apple Development Push Services)
Right-click and choose "Export 2 elements..." and save as server_certificates_bundle_sandbox.p12 (don't type a password).
Open Terminal and change directory to location used to save server_certificates_bundle_sandbox.p12 and convert the PKCS12 certificate bundle into PEM format using this command (press enter when asked for Import Password):
openssl pkcs12 -in server_certificates_bundle_sandbox.p12 -out server_certificates_bundle_sandbox.pem -nodes -clcerts
Now you can use this PEM file as your certificate in ApnsPHP! 



  677  openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -out ck.pem -nodes -clcerts
  681  \cp -rf ck.pem ..
  684  rm /var/log/php/php_errors.log 
  685  sudo service apache2 restart
  688  vi /var/log/php/php_errors.log
